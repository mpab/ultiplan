## ultiplan

### todo: ultiplan
- consider how to link tasks to learnings/learning paths
- implement local tasks repo/deployment (with default project?)
- implement links between ultiplan repos (hierarchichal, sibling, ...)
- add parameters to commands
- design: data flows, aggregation, and task creation (inbox concept)
- implement check to determine if duplicate tasks are being created
- implement analysis mode to scan tasks for similarities, extract keywords, suggest groupings, etc
- implement multi-line text entry/handle commas
- improve list command formatting
- design: how to integrate browser favourites?
- design: how to integrate gists?
- add ability to specify sub-projects/epics/BTIs (Big Ticket Items) for sub-grouping within a project
- add lists to descriptions using dash (-) separators and use these to format the reports
- reporting: implement calendar display
- design: implement a workflow concept to support tracking of events - e.g. email communications
- similar app - noteplan

    - https://medium.com/hackernoon/markdown-calendar-notes-28b87f965e5d
    - https://hackernoon.com/markdown-calendar-notes-28b87f965e5d
    - https://medium.com/hackernoon/markdown-calendar-notes-28b87f965e5d
- design: how to separate notes, tasks, learning tasks, reading (learning) articles
- simplify adding tasks - 'add' command, default to 'todo'
- implement true cli - with menu system to navigate commands
- implement projects using tags - will simplify the data model
- implement auto-linking of data, e.g. registration when creating a new DB
- installer: detect shell environment and update correct profile (sh, bash, zsh, ...)
- task schema: refactor named fields to k,v tag model
- task schema: improve documentation
    - https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/MkDocs_MiSTer
- data linking
    - scan tasks and look for similar wording/phrases/key words
    - can be done at a description level or at a tag level (what about custom tags)
    - extract the phrases into a dictionary
    - link tasks using the dictionary
    - dictionary should be dynamic and implemented as a separate schema
- graph ui
    - create a UI view of the tasks (and data linking schema)
