- implement analysis mode to scan tasks for similarities, extract keywords, suggest groupings, etc
- improve list command formatting
- design: how to integrate browser favourites?
- design: how to integrate gists?

- data linking
    - scan tasks and look for similar wording/phrases/key words
    - can be done at a description level or at a tag level (what about custom tags)
